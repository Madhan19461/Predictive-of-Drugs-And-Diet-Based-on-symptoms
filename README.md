This project aims to develop a machine learning-based predictive model that recommends appropriate medications and dietary interventions based on individual symptoms.
The model analyzes symptom data, categorizes the symptoms, and predicts the most effective drugs and dietary adjustments for specific symptoms or conditions.
By providing personalized recommendations, the goal is to improve health outcomes and reduce the need for trial and error in medication and dietary choices.
A predictive model for drugs and diet based on symptoms involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze symptom data and recommend appropriate medications and dietary interventions. 
The project would likely involve collecting symptom data from individuals, categorizing the symptoms, and then training the model on this data to predict the most effective drugs and dietary adjustments for specific symptoms or conditions. 
The goal is to provide personalized recommendations that can improve health outcomes and potentially reduce the need for trial and error in medication and dietary choices.
